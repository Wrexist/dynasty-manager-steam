/**
 * Week-1 onboarding checklist surfaced on the Dashboard.
 *
 * The first session of a new career is the highest-impact moment for
 * teaching players the systems — once they've advanced to week 2 they're
 * already inside the weekly loop. This card sits above the fold on
 * Dashboard for `week === 1 && season === 1 && prestigeLevel === 0`,
 * lists concrete tasks, and auto-disappears once the user advances week
 * or toggles `settings.hideOnboarding`.
 *
 * Each row opens an over-explicit step-by-step walkthrough modal that
 * spells out exactly where to tap. Tapping "Take me there" navigates to
 * the actual screen.
 *
 * Visibility / completion rules — all derived from observable state, no
 * save migration:
 *   - Card hidden if: week !== 1, season !== 1, prestigeLevel > 0,
 *     settings.hideOnboarding === true, or session-dismissed.
 *   - Sponsor row done when sponsorOffers.length === 0.
 *   - Scout row done when scouting.assignments.length > 0; hidden entirely
 *     when scouting.maxAssignments === 0 (user has no scout on staff
 *     yet — Staff hire row is added as a replacement so the checklist
 *     can still complete).
 *   - Advance-week row never ticks; advancing hides the entire card via
 *     the week-guard.
 *
 * Visual treatment uses the project's LIQUID_GLASS_SURFACE constant +
 * the GlassPanel decorative specular layer, matching the rest of the
 * dark glass-morphism design language.
